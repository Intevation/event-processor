        template string for the subject line of the email.

      - The rest of the lines are the email body. Leading and trailing
        white space is removed from the body and a newline added at the
        end. This allows e.g. an empty line in the template between the
        subject line and the body.

        Template object, thus allowing some simple substitutions. See
        the different formatter implementations for the substitions they
        support.
