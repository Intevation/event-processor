Design rationale:
    Our services shall be accessed by https://github.com/Intevation/intelmq-fody
    so our "endpoints" should be reachable from the same ip:port as
    the checkticket endpoints.

    We need location and credentials for the database holding the contactdb.
    checkticket.py [1] (a hug based backend) solves this problem by reusing
    the intelmq-mailgen configuration to access the 'intelmq-events' database.
    This serving part need to access a different database 'contactdb', thus
    we start with our on configuration.

        * Better than intelmq-mailgen which has two hard-coded places
